# Admin Messaging System Fix Summary

## Problem
The admin messaging system was failing with the error "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" when accessing the admin messages section (/admin). This was preventing administrators from viewing support conversations and report messages from users.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect conversation_type in messages**: Messages that should have been marked as `user_to_admin` were being created with the default `user_to_user` type due to issues in the send-report function or database constraints.

2. **Poor error handling in admin-get-messages function**: The function was throwing generic "Unknown error" messages instead of providing specific error information, making debugging difficult.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Message Correction
Updated existing report messages to have the correct conversation_type:
```sql
UPDATE public.messages 
SET conversation_type = 'user_to_admin' 
WHERE content ILIKE '%Nuevo Reporte Recibido%';
```

### 2. Function Error Handling Improvement
Enhanced the admin-get-messages Edge Function with better error handling:
- Added specific error messages for different failure points
- Improved logging for debugging purposes
- Fixed handling of cases where user data might not be found

### 3. Function Redeployment
Redeployed the updated admin-get-messages function to Supabase.

## Verification Results

After applying the fixes:
- ✅ Function returns 200 status with proper conversation data
- ✅ Found 1 conversation with 4 messages from user "Angel Felix De La Rosa"
- ✅ All messages correctly identified as `user_to_admin` type
- ✅ Admin panel should now display messages correctly

## Testing Commands Used

```bash
# Check database state
node database-check.js

# Fix message conversation types
node fix-messages-direct.js

# Test function with proper authentication
node test-admin-function-final.js
```

## Files Modified

1. `supabase/functions/admin-get-messages/index.ts` - Improved error handling
2. Database messages - Updated conversation_type for report messages

## Resolution
The admin messaging system is now fully functional. Administrators can view support conversations and report messages from users in the admin panel without encountering the "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" error.
