# Profile Loading Issue - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When new users registered, confirmed their email, and logged in, their profile page didn't load and showed the error:
"Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object."

Additionally, subsequent errors occurred:
1. "uid is not defined" in the processProfileData function
2. "setProfile is not defined" in the processProfileData function

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple factors:

1. **Database Synchronization Issues**: Incomplete synchronization between `auth.users`, `public.users`, and `public.public_profiles` tables
2. **Trigger Failures**: The `handle_new_user()` trigger was failing to create entries in the public tables
3. **Frontend Scope Issues**: The `processProfileData` function was defined outside the component but trying to use state setters that are only available inside the component scope

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema and Synchronization Fixes
- Updated migration script (`002_fix_user_profiles.sql`) with improved sync_public_profile function
- Created SQL scripts to fix missing profiles for existing users
- Enhanced error handling and logging in database triggers

### 2. Frontend Code Fixes
- **Fixed "uid is not defined" error**: Updated the processProfileData function to accept userId as a parameter and pass it correctly from all call sites
- **Fixed "setProfile is not defined" error**: Moved the processProfileData function inside the ProfilePage component so it has access to component state setters

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Changed from `single()` to `maybeSingle()` for better error handling
- Added fallback mechanisms for users missing from public tables
- Improved error messages and user feedback

## Files Modified

### Backend (Database)
- `supabase/migrations/002_fix_user_profiles.sql` - Updated migration script
- `fix-missing-public-profiles.sql` - SQL script to fix missing profiles
- `fix-missing-profiles.js` - JavaScript script for programmatic fixing

### Frontend
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - 
  - Moved `processProfileData` function inside the component
  - Updated to use `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()`
  - Fixed parameter passing to ensure proper scope access

## Verification
The fix has been verified through:
1. Code analysis to ensure proper function scoping
2. TypeScript error checking
3. Functional testing of the profile loading mechanism

## Testing Instructions
To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Register a new user
2. Confirm their email
3. Log in and navigate to /profile
4. The profile should load without errors

## Additional Notes
- The solution ensures all new users will have proper profile entries created
- Existing users with missing profile data will be automatically fixed
- Error handling has been improved to prevent similar issues in the future
- The frontend now properly handles cases where profile data might be temporarily missing

This comprehensive fix addresses both the immediate issue and provides long-term stability for user profile management.
